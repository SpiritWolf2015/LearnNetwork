PPPoE exchange between a Telecom Italia ADSL CPE and one of their Juniper (ex-Unisphere) BNASes.

CPE sends a discovery initiation frame (PADI) and receives an offer (PADO).
CPE sends an authentication request with dummy credentials "aliceadsl" both for username and password. These are useless, since the actual authentication is performed thanks to the DSLAM intercepting the PPPoE discovery frames and adding in a Circuit-ID/NAS-Port-ID tag, which is unique for the customer DSLAM port. This tag is then verified against a RADIUS server on Telecom Italia's premises. This process is hidden and transparent to the user and cannot be shown here.
Post-authentication, our CPE receives back IPCP messages containing configuration information, such as public IP, default gateway and DNS configuration.
We're now on the Internet. PPP LCP Echo requests and Echo replies are sent as session keep-alive check.
