# http2-in-action

This is the source code listing for the [*Manning Publications*](https://www.manning.com) book [*HTTP/2 in Action*](https://www.manning.com/books/http2-in-action).

There is not a huge amount of code here I'll be honest, and it's not the most complicated. This is because the book is not a traditional programming book aimed at teahcing you a programming language, but is instead about a protocol, and aims to teach you concepts rather than code. However to save you typing out the examples I've places the few small pieces of code I do have online [here](https://github.com/bazzadp/http2-in-action).

For feedback, feel free to raise an issue or comment on the [book's forum](https://forums.manning.com/forums/http2-in-action).
